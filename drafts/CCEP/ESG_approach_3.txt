Sustainable business practices in core strategy, focusing on people and the environment Title: Coca-Cola's Water Security Strategy: A Commitment to People and Ecosystems

The Coca-Cola Company, a global leader in beverages, has long prioritized sustainable business practices as part of its core strategy. In line with this commitment, the company has announced a more focused effort on water security through its 2030 Water Security Strategy. This sub-section of Coca-Cola's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) approach is critical as water scarcity becomes an increasingly pressing issue in many regions around the world.

James Quincey, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, stated in the 2022 Business & Sustainability Report, "We work with partners to provide access to a steady supply of clean water for people and ecosystems in the areas where we operate and source ingredients." This collaborative approach is essential as the company recognizes that ensuring water security is not just a business issue but also a social responsibility.

Coca-Cola's Water Security Strategy includes increasing its focus on water-stressed regions, replenishing water used in their finished beverages to nature and communities, and working with partners to improve access to clean water. In 2022, the company reported a remarkable 159% water replenishment rate. This means that for every liter of water used in the production of their beverages, they returned 1.59 liters to nature and communities.

Coca-Cola's sustainability efforts extend beyond its Water Security Strategy. The company is also committed to reducing its carbon footprint, promoting sustainable agriculture, minimizing packaging waste, and engaging with stakeholders on critical issues. These initiatives are part of the company's broader goal of building a more resilient business that responds to current and future challenges while creating positive change for the planet.

In conclusion, Coca-Cola's Water Security Strategy is an essential component of its ESG approach. By focusing on increasing water security in areas where they operate and sourcing ingredients, replenishing water used in their beverages, and working with partners to improve access to clean water, the company demonstrates its commitment to people and ecosystems. This approach not only benefits the environment but also helps ensure the long-term sustainability of Coca-Cola's business operations.Prioritizing water security with a focus on water-stressed regions and replenishing 159% of the water used in finished beverages in 2022
