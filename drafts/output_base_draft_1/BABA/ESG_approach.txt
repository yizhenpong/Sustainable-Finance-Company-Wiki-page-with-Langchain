In the realm of carbon emissions reduction, Coca-Cola adheres to strict criteria when considering carbon credits. These certifications must be granted by credible bodies following leading industry guidance, ensuring transparency and science alignment in emission reductions. The company continues to monitor emerging guidelines on the application of carbon credits (Metrics and Targets section).

To address plastic waste reduction, Coca-Cola partners with organizations like WWF on initiatives such as the Plastic Smart Cities project. This collaboration brings together cities and tourism destinations to combat plastic pollution by reducing leakage into nature by 30%. In Tangier, Morocco, this partnership, along with local waste management departments, has collected over 3,900 metric tons of plastic waste since 2021 (Metrics and Targets section).
