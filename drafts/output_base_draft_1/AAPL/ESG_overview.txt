Header: ESG_overview /n  Apple is a technology company that prioritizes Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives in various aspects of its business. According to the 2023 Environmental Progress Report, Apple sources a significant portion of its energy from renewable resources. Specifically, the report states that 100% of the electricity used at two data centers in China is sourced from renewable energy through a solar project. In 2022, this initiative avoided more than 60,503 metric tons of CO2e during the fiscal year.

Additionally, Apple is working on improving its products' recyclability and recovering materials at higher qualities. The company is developing intelligent disassembly technology by investing in research with Carnegie Mellon University. This project includes open-source software for other industry players, X-ray imaging with RGB imaging, and optimizing robots to handle objects and adjust to contact, enabling them to "feel" using high-frequency force feedback and machine learning.

Apple is also committed to addressing social injustices and upholding labor and human rights, health and safety, and environmental stewardship across its global supply chain. More information on these efforts can be found in the People and Environment in Our Supply Chain 2023 Annual Progress Report. /n
