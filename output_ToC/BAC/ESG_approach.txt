3. Risk Management (including Risk Identification 
  Building off the Company's established Risk Framework, in 2023, the Company introduced its internal Climate Risk Framework. This framework outlines how climate risks are identified, measured, monitored, and controlled. Climate risk manifestations across different categories include physical risks, such as extreme weather events, and transition risks, like regulatory changes and technology shifts (Risk Identification section below).

The Company embeds climate risk considerations into its enterprise risk management practices to support Responsible Growth and prepare for a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. The evolving Climate Risk Framework is anticipated to mature alongside best practices in climate risk management (Strategic Goals section, Governance).

Key contextual information essential for understanding and supporting clients encompasses emissions data, such as absolute emissions and intensity; contribution to the portfolio's emissions based on sectoral targets; and relationship metrics like revenues, returns, historical client relationships, and future business opportunities (Table of Contents: Strategy | Align). Additionally, output from Climate and Environmental Risk Assessment (CERA) is analyzed for awareness disclosure score, physical risk score, transition risk score, strategy and mitigation score, and overall composite CERA score.

Decarbonization strategies consist of a Net Zero transition plan or commitments with progress targets, governance, and strategic importance; investment in carbon reduction projects; and capital expenditure allocated to the Net Zero transition (Table of Contents: Strategy | Assist).

The Company's Board of Directors oversees all environmental and social sustainability matters, including climate risks and opportunities. Board-level committees, such as the Enterprise Risk Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation and Human Capital Committee, and Corporate Governance, ESG and Sustainability Committee, have defined roles in addressing climate-related risks and opportunities (Governance). Management is accountable for implementing the climate strategy and overseeing day-to-day operations.

The Climate Risk Framework covers a 30-year period from 2021 to 2051, with short-, medium-, and long-term horizons and acute and chronic climate impact assessments (Period and Time Horizon). The scope includes direct impacts like carbon risk, market risk, operational risk, and liquidity risk; as well as indirect impacts on macroeconomic variables like the Manufacturing Productivity Index and the House Price Index.

In support of sustainability and socioeconomic empowerment for underserved populations and regions, the Company invests in initiatives like the Equality Progress Sustainability Bond, which focuses on racial and gender equality, economic opportunity, and environmental sustainability (Company Efforts to Assist Clients). Through partnerships with governments, regional lenders, development finance institutions, and philanthropies, it aims to bridge the funding gap and mobilize private capital for sustainable development in emerging markets.

The Company also provides assurance over clients' environmental data and social information in accordance with relevant auditing standards (Scope of Work). In doing so, its work includes assessing the appropriateness of reporting criteria, conducting interviews with relevant personnel, reviewing data collection processes, assessing assumptions made, and verifying documentary evidence. By implementing these practices and initiatives, the Company continues to promote climate risk management and sustainable development across its operations and partnerships.

  Risk Management: Climate Scenario Analysis and Commercial Credit Enhancements

In addition to evaluating industry risks, companies are increasingly focusing on climate-related risks as a critical component of their risk management strategies. One such company uses a framework to assess climate risks at the country level, supplementing its existing enterprise credit risk analysis. This assessment includes physical and transition risks and assigns climate scores to countries based on proprietary methodology, expert judgment, and third-party indicators (Country Risk section).

As more regulations and reporting requirements emerge in response to climate change, there is a growing need for companies to update their historical emissions data. These updates may lead to restatements of financial metrics, as seen in this company's 2023 Sustainable Finance Metrics and Targets report (METRICS AND TARGETS section).

To better understand the potential impact of climate risks on its business, the company has expanded its climate scenario analysis capabilities. By incorporating granular segmentation and differentiation at the industry and region/country level, the company's wholesale credit models can now identify potential pockets of risks within its key portfolios (Commercial Credit Enhancements section). Integrated with third-party models, these internal tools enable the company to analyze financial impacts at the company level and provide insights into how climate risk drivers affect liquidity and the specific capabilities required to address these risks more effectively.

Moreover, this company is committed to adhering to recognized sustainability frameworks such as the Green and Social Bond Principles administered by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). By following guidelines and governance related to climate risk disclosure and restatement, the company continues to enhance its ability to manage and report on these critical risks in a transparent manner.

Climate-related risks can have far-reaching impacts across multiple sectors and geographies, including operational and reputational risks, supply chain disruptions, consumer preference shifts, and market changes (Risk Management section). As this company continues to expand its modeling capabilities and deepen its understanding of climate risk drivers, it remains at the forefront of effective risk management strategies for a sustainable future.

Commercial Credit Enhancements: The company has substantially expanded its wholesale credit forecasting capabilities by performing portfolio deep dives, creating an internal suite of models that offer granular segmentation and differentiation at both the industry and region/country level. Integrating these internal models with third-party models incorporating climate-specific risk factors enables the identification of potential climate risks, while ongoing improvement is essential to maximize their value in delivering meaningful and actionable insights (Commercial Credit Enhancements section).

Granular segmentation and differentiation in modeling: The company has developed a suite of wholesale credit models with granular segmentation and differentiation at both the industry and region/country level to expand its climate forecasting capabilities substantially (Commercial Credit Enhancements section).

Enhanced modeling for regulatory compliance: As regulations related to climate change reporting increase in number and complexity, this company has enhanced its internal modeling capabilities to enable adherence to various jurisdictions' requirements and facilitate more comprehensive risk management practices (Risk Management and Commercial Credit Enhancements sections). 
 Sub header: Risk Monitoring 
  Risk Management at this leading financial institution goes beyond traditional industry evaluations, integrating climate risk assessments into their existing capabilities. The Enterprise Credit Risk team uses a proprietary methodology to assign climate scores to countries in their coverage universe, taking into account physical and transition risks from climate change. These ratings are crucial for understanding potential impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, consumer preference, and markets (Country Risk, 2023).

To effectively assess the transition to a Net Zero economy, the financial institution has expanded modeling capabilities for enhanced climate scenario analysis. This process allows them to evaluate various transition risk and physical risk events, providing deeper insights into evolving climate risks and opportunities. Climate risks can significantly impact a company's balance sheet (Commercial Credit Enhancements, 2023).

In response to increased regulatory requirements and industry guidance, the financial institution follows specific guidelines for restating prior metrics related to financing activity emissions estimates, enhancing data accuracy and compliance (Metrics and Targets, 2023). By aligning with international sustainability alliances and expanding existing sustainable finance activities, the financial institution is dedicated to driving thought leadership and innovation in climate finance (Sustainable Finance Metrics and Targets, 2023).

The company's commitment to transparency extends beyond reporting. The Executive Management Team tracks and reports sustainability metrics to the Board, who evaluate progress toward their $1.5 trillion sustainable finance commitment and Net Zero goal. Focused business units focus directly on climate innovation, with evaluations based on revenue streams in alignment with UN SDGs. Additionally, responsible sourcing strategies are considered when engaging suppliers and evaluating climate change management (Consumer Enhancements, 2023).

Enhanced scenario analysis capabilities enable the financial institution to test their risk exposure under various climate-related scenarios, assisting in the identification of potential risks for their clients investing in the environmental transition (Risk Management, 2023). Launching initiatives like the Impactonomics® reports serves as part of an ongoing effort to educate clients about energy transition and policy changes.

4. Metrics and Targets (environmental footprint 
  At Bank of America, we are committed to assessing climate-related risks through scenario analysis and setting ambitious targets for our Net Zero Transition Plan (NZTP). Our approach to achieving this goal is multifaceted, encompassing strategic client engagement, deeper understanding of clients and analytics to measure performance.

Firstly, as part of our Approach to Zero™ and Net Zero objective, we have established metrics and targets for financing activities in key carbon-intensive sectors. In 2022, we announced weighted average physical unit intensity targets for the auto manufacturing, energy, and power generation sectors, with plans to publish annual progress on these targets. By working closely with clients and portfolio companies to encourage Net Zero-aligned transition strategies, we believe that proactive engagement can help drive meaningful change in these industries.

Our commitment to a net-zero future extends beyond our own operations, as we understand the importance of industry collaboration and advocacy for consistent global standards. We engage with peers in the financial sector to exchange expertise and address common challenges related to transition planning, and we collectively represent the industry's views cohesively to external stakeholders, such as governments and clients.

Our Board of Directors plays a critical role in overseeing environmental and social sustainability matters, including climate risks and opportunities. They engage with management on climate topics, setting milestone targets for net-zero emissions before 2050. Management-level committees are responsible for the execution of this strategy, and they employ various risk management practices to assess climate risk in a comprehensive manner.

As we work toward our Net Zero goal, we recognize that physical risks associated with climate change may pose significant challenges to our operational resilience. For instance, extreme flooding and storm surges could cause prolonged economic impacts on homes, buildings, infrastructure, and businesses. We utilize scenario analysis exercises, including assessments of potential credit risk impact on commercial and industrial portfolios and physical risk impact on mortgage-backed securities within our trading portfolio. By proactively addressing these risks, we can contribute to a more resilient and sustainable future for our stakeholders. 
 Sub header: social impact 
  Bank of America (BofA) is at the forefront of driving innovative financial solutions to address climate change and promote social impact. The bank recognizes that collective action from various stakeholders, including governments, corporations, and individuals, is crucial in achieving net-zero emissions. BofA's public policy team engages with policymakers worldwide, advocating for policies that facilitate the private sector's efforts in transitioning to a low-carbon economy (1).

One way governments can contribute is through public finance. Governments can utilize tax incentives and concessional loans to enhance returns on climate technology investments. These financial tools help lower risks and costs associated with emerging technologies, enabling broader adoption. Another strategy involves governments using procurement power to drive adoption of existing and innovative technologies, thereby reducing costs for all stakeholders (1).

BofA's commitment to social impact extends to infrastructure projects as well. With a portfolio of approximately $13.5 billion invested in renewable wind and solar energy by the end of 2022, BofA has contributed to the development of around 40.7 gigawatts of renewable capacity in the U.S (1). The bank's efforts go beyond utility-scale projects as they also finance distributed generation for residential and commercial/industrial customers and Electric Vehicles (EVs) (1).

BofA is committed to addressing climate risk within its operations, implementing sustainability expertise through a newly established Sustainability Business Solutions Group (SBSG) in its Global Commercial and Investment Banking division. The SBSG collaborates with clients to structure and execute transactions where sustainability factors play a role, providing essential tools like a common enterprise taxonomy for climate risk analysis and stress testing (1).

Moreover, BofA produces climate scenario analysis to identify the impact of transition risks on trading portfolios. By focusing on understanding these risks, they can help their clients be better prepared for the shifting climate risk landscape and the challenges it presents (1).

Looking ahead, BofA continues its commitment to working closely with stakeholders in both the public and private sectors to further improve the identification, measurement, monitoring, and control of climate risk. With evolving regulatory requirements, they anticipate continued progress towards their net-zero goal and will adapt accordingly (1).

BofA recognizes the significance of a balanced and just transition to achieve a low-carbon future while maintaining economic opportunity and prosperity. Their commitment to collaboration, innovation, and advocacy for enabling policies positions them as key players in the ongoing climate change narrative. However, they acknowledge that much more work remains to be done as the clean energy transition continues to evolve and challenge us all.
