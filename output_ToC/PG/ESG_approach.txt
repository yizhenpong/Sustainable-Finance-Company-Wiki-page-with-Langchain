  Title: Environmental Sustainability at America's Top Corporations - P&G's Innovative Approaches

P&G, a prominent member of America's Top Corporations recognized by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and the Ohio Minority Supplier Development Council (OMSDC), is committed to sustainable innovation across various domains, including environmental sustainability. One of their primary focuses lies in optimizing their palm supply chain through advanced monitoring technologies and reporting processes.

To strengthen their palm oil sourcing, P&G is implementing Earthqualizer's technology across their third-party supplier network (primary focus on Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea). This system enables the proactive identification and resolution of environmental concerns related to deforestation or peatland development. These efforts are incorporated into their ongoing grievance monitoring process. Reporting every four months on www.pg.com, P&G is committed to transparency and accountability, with the first report planned for January 2021.

Regarding energy efficiency, P&G made considerable progress toward reducing energy use by 20% per unit of production as per their 2020 goal, achieving a reduction of 19%. Their manufacturing sites, offices, and tech centers have continuously improved energy usage through optimization. These efforts have resulted in cost savings and decoupling business growth from greenhouse gas emissions, despite increasing production volumes over the past five years.

P&G's commitment to environmental sustainability extends beyond their internal operations, as they foster partnerships that promote equality and people with disabilities. In Spain, P&G collaborated with Fundación ONCE "Oportunidad al Talento" program to grant scholarships to university students with disabilities. Additionally, they partnered with Randstad's Integrados to facilitate access to employment for people with disabilities in Madrid.

Furthermore, P&G is spearheading the 50L Home Coalition, aiming to transform urban water management and enable individuals to live on just 50 liters of water usage per day. This project, which incorporates efforts to save both water and energy in homes, embodies P&G's forward-thinking approach to environmental sustainability and resource efficiency.

P&G is also taking action to protect forests, with a significant partnership with WWF in Russia. These initiatives represent just a few examples of how P&G integrates sustainable practices into their operations and business relationships. By focusing on areas such as monitoring, energy efficiency, renewable energy, waste reduction, and collaborative efforts, P&G continues to strive for circular solutions and environmental sustainability.
