  This company is deeply committed to making a positive impact on communities around the world, going beyond its business operations to provide support during times of need, such as in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding environmental sustainability, the company aims for zero notices or penalties related to compliance with various laws and regulations governing health, safety, and the environment. In FY19/20, three violations were reported, with associated fines totaling $5,960 for water-based and air-based issues. The company continues its efforts to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency, aiming for significant reductions in greenhouse gases by 2030 as part of its "Brand 2030" initiative (Document page:12).

In terms of environmental sustainability, the company is focused on reducing water usage, with a decrease of approximately 20% per unit of production since FY09/10 (Document page:154). Additionally, efforts are being made to address climate change and enhance supply chain transparency. The document does not provide specific data points for reductions in carbon emissions or other key environmental issues (Document pages:3, 8-9), but the company expresses a commitment to increasing focus on these areas in response to the growing urgency surrounding climate change.

The company is also dedicated to promoting sustainable lifestyles and sustainable product design and innovation (Document page:9). In this regard, it strives for continuous improvement across its brands and operations while ensuring compliance with labor standards and respecting human rights (Document pages:167, 153). Notable progress includes the elimination of certain fees charged to workers, as well as the implementation of policies addressing forced labor and non-discrimination.
