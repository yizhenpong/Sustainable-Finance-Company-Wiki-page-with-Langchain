 Sub header: Human Rights 
  Title: Human Rights and Modern Slavery Risks in Johnson & Johnson's Supply Base

Johnson & Johnson (J&J), a leading healthcare company, has shown its commitment to respecting human rights by providing mandatory training for its procurement employees. With 93% of them completing the program in 2022, J&J aims to prevent modern slavery and other human rights violations in its extensive supply chain (Rosey Hurst, Impactt).

In line with this commitment, J&J's Sustainability Culture & Engagement team under Deb Gorhan drives the development of frameworks, policies, and positions to uphold respect for human rights. These guidelines extend to their suppliers through the Responsibility Standards (Deb Gorhan). Additionally, employees in key departments like ESG Governance, overseeing areas like corporate secretary, Head of Litigation, leaders from Controllers’ office, Investor Relations, and Global Audit & Assurance, ensure the adherence to J&J's human rights principles (Johnson & Johnson).

Gary Harbison, Chief Information Security Officer, underlines the importance of securing sensitive business information as foundational for maintaining business continuity and serving their customers effectively (Gary Harbison). However, this focus on internal controls raises concerns about potential blind spots in external supply chain risks. Modern slavery represents a significant human rights risk that might not always be apparent within an organization's immediate operations but could impact J&J's suppliers (Modern Slavery: A Business Risk, The Guardian).

Moreover, J&J collaborates with external organizations such as the Diverse Surgeon Initiative to improve their approach in creating businesses where positive social impact is intricately linked with size and growth. Their work with partners like SwipeRx also reflects a focus on addressing community needs through health-related initiatives (Farouk Meralli, SwipeRx).

However, the sheer complexity and vastness of the global healthcare industry make it challenging for J&J to ensure human rights protections are upheld across its extensive supply base. Despite its best efforts in providing human rights training and maintaining robust internal controls, there remains a risk that modern slavery might be present within their supply chain. This is not an uncommon challenge for companies in the healthcare sector, given its intricate network of interconnected suppliers and stakeholders (Global Risks Report 2021, World Economic Forum).

In response to this, Johnson & Johnson should consider employing strategies like regular audits, due diligence processes, transparency requirements, and continuous communication with their suppliers about human rights expectations. Engaging third-party experts or joining multi-stakeholder initiatives such as the Ethical Trading Initiative can also strengthen J&J's commitment to upholding human rights standards throughout its supply chain (Modern Slavery: A Business Risk, The Guardian). 
 Sub header: Water Scarcity & Management 
  Paragraph 1: Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is committed to sustainable business practices that protect the environment and promote health and well-being for future generations.

This collaboration addresses the urgency of water scarcity issues and other health challenges while fostering long-term solutions.

Paragraph 3: The ongoing threat of pandemics and epidemics necessitates the adoption of advanced digital capabilities to safeguard information security, protect business continuity, and facilitate remote work and collaboration. Gary Harbison, J&J's Chief Information Security Officer, stresses the significance of digital acumen in response to current challenges. J&J has embraced a hybrid working framework that combines flexibility with a globally consistent approach, which includes onboarding new employees digitally and training them remotely.

Paragraph 4: Farouk Meralli, CEO of SwipeRx and participant in the J&J Innovation (JJIV) program, highlights how the collaboration between businesses like J&J and local organizations has led to significant impact outcomes. These collaborative efforts aim to create sustainable solutions addressing water scarcity issues and improving healthcare access while fostering diversity and equity.

The company continually invests in emerging technologies such as 4IR (Fourth Industrial Revolution) to improve its operations, optimize its supply chain, and enhance overall business performance. For instance, the Janssen Supply Chain leverages technology to manage inventory at the point of consumption and ensure the right orthopaedic implants reach the right patient in a timely manner. By increasing operational efficiency, these technologies ultimately reduce the energy consumption required for traditional manufacturing and supply chain processes.

Another area where Johnson & Johnson is making progress is supplier diversity and community engagement. As part of its Health for Humanity 2025 goals, Johnson & Johnson aims to advance critical healthcare innovations in areas such as mental health, where access remains meager in many countries and business segments. For example, the company's CASPAR study team has made significant progress in Rwanda, achieving a nearly 50% success rate in moving patients with schizophrenia from the screening phase to treatment. Johnson & Johnson also invests in clinical research trainings for site investigators to advance these important projects and improve access to essential mental healthcare services.

In conclusion, Johnson & Johnson's dedication to sustainability and ESG evaluation is evident across various aspects of its business operations. The company's emphasis on employee engagement, information security, innovation, supplier diversity, and community engagement enables it to make decisions today that protect the environment and contribute to the health and wellbeing of future generations.
