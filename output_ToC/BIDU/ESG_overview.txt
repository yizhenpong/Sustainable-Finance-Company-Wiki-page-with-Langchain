Header: ESG_overview 
  Baidu, the leading Chinese tech company, is committed to sustainable business practices in various aspects, from enhancing employee awareness of environmental protection to developing intelligent and paperless offices. In line with global sustainability goals, Baidu has made strides towards carbon reduction with its "520, Low Carbon Action" campaign among employees and the creation of an "Innovation Assembly Line."

Under the Innovation Assembly Line initiative, Baidu has produced intelligent office products and services such as Baidu Infoflow. By optimizing data flow in financial, personnel, conference, and park management, this solution realized paperless and low-energy offices, saving an estimated 1.06 million pieces of paper in 2022. This is just one of many achievements aligned with the Addressing Climate Change: Green Operations theme.

Furthermore, Baidu has focused on ESG management by providing self-developed courses to employees, ensuring access to information for all social groups (in line with the ESG themes of Equality and Human Rights), and conducting regular technical lectures. These efforts facilitate professional development while improving capabilities among team members.

Beyond this report, Baidu continues to explore new ways of making the world simpler through technology while adhering to the four principles of AI ethics: safety and controllability, promoting equal access, empowerment of mankind, and freedom.

Moving on to the other themes we covered earlier, Addressing Climate Change: Green Products and Services and Green Corporate Governance are evident through initiatives like "520, Low Carbon Action" campaign and Baidu's publication on constructing business ethics and anti-fraud supervision system. Additionally, the company nurtures talent through various programs and enhances services by providing free professional medical consultation for employees, all while contributing to international and national security standards development.

These efforts underscore Baidu's dedication towards promoting sustainability and alignment with global ESG trends, making them an essential player in the evolving landscape of sustainable finance.
