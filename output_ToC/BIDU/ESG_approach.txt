  Title: Baidu's Green Operations: Addressing Climate Change through Intelligent Transportation Systems

Baidu, a leading Chinese multinational technology company, has been proactively addressing climate change through its green operations initiative, focusing particularly on the area of intelligent transportation. The company's advanced technologies in AI and cloud computing have enabled significant progress in optimizing vehicles and roads, enhancing mobility services, and promoting autonomous driving.

One of Baidu's key initiatives is Intersection Optimization. Leveraging AI algorithms and big data analytics, Baidu Maps has developed intelligent scheduling solutions to improve logistics efficiency, reduce incorrect order information, and minimize carbon emissions caused by ineffective route planning in the logistics sector (Green Logistics). By comprehensively considering vehicle types, restrictions, and costs, these transportation scheduling solutions aim to generate optimal transportation solutions and promote industries' development in a low-carbon manner.

Baidu also contributes to green mobility through its Connected Vehicle (ICV) ecology, which comprises "Single-Agent Intelligent" and "vehicle-road cooperation." The company has laid out an intelligent driving solution, bringing together intelligent vehicles, roads, and mobility. For instance, in the area of Mobility as a Service, Baidu provides consumers with smarter ways to acquire and manage transport services through electronic interfaces, reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with personal vehicle usage (Green Intelligent Network Connection).

Baidu's ICV technologies are part of its commitment to creating a greener transportation ecosystem. In 2022, the company expanded its environmental performance indicators to cover all of its major offices, data centers, and research centers (Green Operations). Baidu's environmental targets include reducing greenhouse gas emissions from various scopes: direct emissions from stationary combustion sources, indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, and heating, as well as other indirect emissions related to employee commuting and data center power consumption. The company has obtained third-party certifications for its environmental performance indicators to verify and guarantee their accuracy (Green Performance Certification).

In addition, Baidu continues to improve traffic efficiency and reduce carbon emissions caused by both traffic lights and traffic accidents through its Intelligent Transportation engine. By leveraging real-time data from various sources, such as satellite imagery and sensor data from vehicles, the ACE intelligent transportation engine can analyze traffic patterns and adjust signal timing accordingly, improving overall road network performance and reducing unnecessary emissions (Intelligent Traffic Management).

Baidu's extensive efforts in green transportation are not only good for the environment but also contribute to stronger corporate governance, building trust with stakeholders. By continuing its focus on ESG issues through materiality assessment and sustainable development discussions, Baidu remains committed to nurturing talent, improving services, and promoting green ideas as it lays the groundwork for a greener and more intelligent future.

2. ESG Management 
  Title: Baidu's ESG Management in Green Products and Services: Data Compliance, Energy Conservation, and Community Interaction

Baidu, a leading technology company, demonstrates its commitment to sustainability through its comprehensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) management system. This section focuses on three key aspects: data compliance, energy conservation, and community interaction, all contributing significantly to corporate development.

Data Compliance and Security: Data is a crucial asset for Baidu, making data management an essential component of ESG. The company's approach involves Data collection, use, circulation, storage, destruction, and transmission. To ensure data protection, Baidu follows industry standards such as ISO 27001, 27017, 27018, 27032, 27701, 29151, and CSA-STAR for data security international certification. Additionally, the implementation of DSMM data security capacity maturity model and IPv6 Enabled CDN logo adds layers of protection, maintaining trust among users and stakeholders.

Green Energy and Resource Conservation: In terms of energy conservation, Baidu focuses on reducing carbon emissions through low-carbon operations and the development of green intelligent products. For instance, its pavement and infrastructure sensing system utilizes a radar video fusion sensing device to monitor vehicles on expressways under adverse weather conditions, providing safe traffic information and reducing the need for excess energy consumption. The project aims to increase annual carbon emission reduction by an estimated 688.12 t/year through intelligent route planning and scheduling solutions in the logistics sector. Furthermore, Baidu encourages a green culture among its employees, saving over 1.06 million pieces of paper in 2022 through optimizing data usage in financial, personnel, conference management scenarios.

Community Interaction and Sustainability: Through charitable projects, community activities, and user interaction via Baidu websites and social media, the company nurtures a culture of giving back to society. An example of such community involvement includes Baidu's "520, Low Carbon Action" campaign that promotes green lifestyles, reducing waste, and raising awareness on environmental protection among employees. By adhering to these principles, Baidu strengthens corporate governance and ensures long-term sustainable development in alignment with UN SDGs, GRI, SASB standards, and various indexes in the capital market.

In summary, Baidu's ESG management effectively addresses climate change by prioritizing data compliance, green products, and community engagement. The company's dedication to sustainability initiatives enables it to create economic values for its stakeholders while enhancing corporate governance, trust, and nurturing talent.
