They have conducted a living wage gap analysis across their global offices and manufacturing sites, aiming to meet or exceed the BSR living wage benchmark in the majority of their operations. Where gaps exist, they are developing a roadmap to progress toward living wages (BSR 2023 Environmental Progress Report, p.103).

Regarding water security, the company has set three key goals to achieve its vision: achieving 100% regenerative water use across 175 facilities facing high levels of water stress by 2030; improving the health of 60 watersheds critical for their operations and agricultural supply chain by 2030; and returning a cumulative total of 2 trillion liters of water to nature and communities globally over the life of their strategy (between 2021-2030) (Water Leadership).
