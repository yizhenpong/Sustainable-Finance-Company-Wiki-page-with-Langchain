It is important to note that the provided context only mentions Apple in relation to their renewable energy usage and sustainability reporting, so I cannot confirm if these individuals are CEOs or Chief Sustainability Officers for Apple specifically. However, they do appear to be associated with the Fraunhofer IZM research institute, which collaborates with Apple on various environmental initiatives.
