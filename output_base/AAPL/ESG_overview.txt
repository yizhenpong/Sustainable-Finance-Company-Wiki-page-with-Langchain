  Apple is committed to reducing its environmental impact and has made significant strides in achieving its sustainability goals. In the 2023 Environmental Progress Report, Apple announced that its environmental programs avoided over 28 million metric tons of emissions across all scopes in 2022. This achievement was made possible by initiatives such as sourcing 100% renewable electricity for its facilities and transitioning suppliers to renewable energy. Apple's revenue has grown by over 68% since 2015, while gross emissions have decreased by over 45%.

Apple also focuses on reducing water usage and waste management. In 2022, the company disclosed that it withdrew 1,527 million gallons of water worldwide and discharged 679 million gallons. Apple is committed to increasing the amount of recycled materials used in its products, with 35,583 metric tonnes removed by recycling contractors in 2022 and 23,535 metric tonnes recycled internally.

Apple reports on its ESG performance using various frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Apple's sustainability reports are audited in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.

In addition to its environmental efforts, Apple is committed to human rights initiatives and makes ongoing voluntary disclosures, policies, and programs to promote these initiatives. Apple's Self Service Repair program, launched in Europe in 2022, enables customers to repair certain iPhone models, MacBooks, and displays themselves. Apple also has authorized service providers, retail stores, and independent repair providers for more complex repairs.
