  Paragraph 1:
During the unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, several companies have shown exceptional commitment towards supporting their communities. Unilever, a leading consumer goods company, has been one such organization that has taken significant steps to ensure the welfare of its stakeholders and make a positive impact on society. According to the company's 2020 Annual Report (page 3), fire protection audits were halted at some of their sites due to COVID-19, but they remained steadfast in their commitment to upholding human rights throughout their business operations.

Paragraph 2:
Unilever recognizes the importance of respecting human rights and takes this responsibility seriously, especially in regions where legal frameworks may be insufficient or conflicting with internationally recognized human rights. As part of a broader learning initiative, Unilever has developed educational resources to help employees and business partners recognize potential human rights issues in their workplaces (page 4).

Paragraph 3:
In the context of COVID-19, Unilever has responded by providing essential support to healthcare workers and communities in need. In Mexico, for example, Head & Shoulders donated protective kits for healthcare professionals through disaster relief partner CADENA and invited consumers to join in donating (page 5). Similarly, in Peru, Unilever's brand teams acted swiftly to provide hygiene and cleaning products to support COVID-19 patients and health care workers (page 6).

Paragraph 4:
Unilever's efforts extend beyond its immediate operations. The company transformed its end-of-year celebration into an opportunity to support charities, donating over $45,000 each to Macmillan, Refuge, and Calm (page 7). Site teams expanded grants to local charities and provided substantial product donations to frontline workers at NHS hospitals in the UK (page 8). Unilever's hair care brands, Olay and Oral-B, collectively donated nearly $1 million worth of products to support NHS trusts across the country.

Paragraph 5:
In response to the dual crises faced by the Black community – COVID-19 and racism – Unilever's Minority Business Innovation Center (MBIB) initiated a campaign to amplify Black voices and provide solutions for staying healthy and thriving amidst these challenges. MBIB launched a video, "Two Evils," aimed at highlighting the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 and police brutality on the Black community (page 9). They also created live programming on social media to equip the community with tools for engaging in the movement and debunking myths about COVID-19. Through a series titled #HowWe, MBIB addressed various aspects of the crisis, from fighting and winning to surviving and coping.

Paragraph 6:
Unilever's commitment to supporting its communities extends beyond its borders. In Romania, Fairy partnered with the Portuguese Food Bank's Food Emergency Network and Media Capital to launch the "With Fairy, Help Cannot Stop" campaign (page 10). The eleven-day initiative raised over $230,000, with Fairy contributing an additional $50,000. These initiatives demonstrate Unilever's unwavering commitment to making a positive impact on society during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Sub header: Transparent ingredient disclosure 
  Paragraph 1: Transparent Ingredient Disclosure is an essential aspect of Fairy's sustainable finance strategy, and this commitment is reflected in various initiatives the company has undertaken over the years. For instance, during its 10th anniversary celebration, Fairy supported food sustainability by collecting surplus food from supermarkets through the Food Rescue Association and donating it to those in need, helping approximately 660,000 people (source: first sentence).

Paragraph 2: Fairy's dedication to responsible beauty and transparency extends beyond its local community. The company actively engages with stakeholders across industries, advocating for change through partnerships. For example, P&G collaborates with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to develop sustainable practices and drive implementation of programs aimed at improving palm industry supply chain sustainability (source: fifth and sixth paragraph).

Paragraph 3: Transparency in ingredient disclosures is a crucial aspect of Fairy's commitment to its consumers. In 2019, P&G was recognized as the Safer Choice Partner of the Year by the Environmental Protection Agency for its dish, fabric, and surface cleaning products that adhere to EPA Safer Choice criteria (source: eighth paragraph). The company also ensures that all product bottles are recyclable, with laundry detergent bottles containing at least 25% post-consumer recycled plastic.

Paragraph 4: Fairy's dedication to transparency and sustainability is not limited to its product offerings; it also extends to philanthropic initiatives. For instance, the company collaborated with the Portuguese Food Bank, Media Capital, and Food Emergency Network to create the campaign "With Fairy, Help Cannot Stop," raising over $280,000 for those in need during a period of crisis (source: tenth paragraph).

Paragraph 5: As part of its global citizenship goals, Fairy continues to prioritize water protection efforts across seven countries, including Spain and Turkey. Through partnerships, the company aims to address shared water challenges and develop viable solutions (source: eleventh and twelfth paragraphs). By integrating transparency and sustainability into every aspect of its business, Fairy sets an example for other companies in the sustainable finance industry. 
 Sub header: Climate change initiatives 
  Paragraph 1:
P&G's commitment to addressing climate change and protecting water resources is evident in their focus on priority basins across seven countries, including Spain and Turkey. The company continues to collaborate with partners to identify key challenges and viable solutions in each location (181). In Spain and Turkey, new efforts were initiated to guide potential engagement, adding to the existing work being done in China, India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.

Paragraph 2:
Water scarcity is a pressing issue, and P&G recognizes the importance of addressing it through collaborative efforts. In Spain and Turkey, the company has started new initiatives to help address water challenges. However, the scope of P&G's climate change initiatives extends far beyond these two countries. In the United States, for instance, the company supported a large-scale water resilience project (181).

Paragraph 3:
The commitment to protect water resources and mitigate climate change is just one aspect of P&G's sustainability efforts. The company also focuses on community support and health initiatives, particularly in vulnerable regions such as Latin America. In Argentina, for example, P&G made its most significant contribution in its 30-year history by donating millions of products to communities in need, working with key partners (167).

Paragraph 4:
P&G's approach to sustainability is not limited to individual initiatives. The company recognizes the importance of collaboration and partnerships in driving change across industries, particularly within the palm industry supply chain. P&G works closely with various groups like RSPO to develop best practices and implement programs for sustainable palm practices (181). This includes the development of new certification systems and smallholder programs designed to improve sustainability standards.

Paragraph 5:
In addressing climate change and implementing sustainable business practices, a pragmatic approach is essential. For instance, in understanding potential allergens, one can consider proteins' molecular weight and any evidence of ongoing human exposure without reports of an allergic reaction (Krutz et al., 2019, p. 167). This approach enables companies like P&G to make informed decisions and reduce the potential impact on both human health and the environment. By focusing on collaboration, advocacy, and partnerships, P&G continues to lead the way in sustainable business practices.

  Title: Sustainable Lifestyle Promotion at Procter & Gamble: Packaging Reduction, Waste Elimination, and Employee Engagement

Procter & Gamble (P&G), under the leadership of Bertrand Piccard's "Innovating for More Efficient Solutions," has been actively promoting sustainable lifestyles through various initiatives, focusing on reducing packaging, waste elimination, and employee engagement [167]. This section explores P&G's efforts in these areas.

Firstly, P&G has targeted a significant reduction in packaging since 2010, managing to avoid over 200,000 metric tons of it. However, the company acknowledges that this is only a 12% reduction, and market pressures have negatively impacted their progress [170]. For instance, customer demands for smaller case counts led to an increase in corrugate per consumer use in certain markets. To address this challenge, P&G continues to optimize its packaging designs going forward [97].

Secondly, P&G has been actively conducting pilot studies to eliminate landfilled or dumped solid waste in both developed and developing countries [167]. These initiatives aim to improve the company's progress toward its 2030 goals on packaging and waste. One such collaboration is with Sinba, an NGO dedicated to transforming organic waste into food for pigs. Through this alliance, P&G has organized training and activities for employees to properly prepare their recyclable waste for recycling organizations [169]. As a result, toy pigs were placed on top of organic waste bins to raise awareness about the consequences of tossing non-organic waste in the trash [169].

Thirdly, P&G's employees are deeply committed to environmental sustainability and continue taking actions to accomplish the company's goals. For instance, they organize recycling contests, workshops, and create "Ecologic Stops" to test employees on their knowledge of separating recyclables [169].

Fourthly, P&G has implemented a Smart-Box system, which is a simple yet effective solution for sustainability. The Smart-Box is designed to optimize packaging and reduce waste by minimizing the need for outer cartons when shipping products in smaller quantities [124]. Overall, Procter & Gamble's sustainable lifestyle promotion efforts are multifaceted and demonstrate their dedication to reducing packaging, eliminating waste, and engaging employees in these initiatives. 
 Sub header: Sustainable product design. 
  Paragraph 1: Proactive Engagement with Stakeholders
At P&G, we prioritize sustainable product design through active engagement with our stakeholders, including individual shareholders and other concerned parties. We believe in the importance of transparency and two-way communication, as evidenced by our response to the #HairWeGo campaign that led to a permanent change in Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Education's school policy (Source: p. x). In 2019, we hosted a townhall discussion featuring Matthew Price, P&G President for Greater China, who shared insights on the significance of integrity and strong stewardship in driving business success (Source: p. y).

Paragraph 2: Gender Equality and Human Rights
In line with our commitment to sustainability, we are making intentional strides to address gender equality within our organization. This effort extends beyond our executive levels, where we are implementing plans to accelerate progress among our business and technical associate roles (Source: p. z). Regarding human rights, we uphold the responsibility of respecting these fundamental rights throughout our operations, even in jurisdictions with inadequate legal frameworks or enforcement mechanisms (Source: p. a-c). To further this commitment, we have created educational resources to help employees and partners recognize potential human rights issues within their workplaces.

Paragraph 3: Nature-Powered Innovation and Collaboration
P&G's commitment to sustainable product design is also demonstrated through our nature-powered innovation initiatives. One such endeavor involves collaborating with Cargill to convert lactic acid into bio-based acrylic acid, which can be used in a variety of everyday goods (Source: p. d). This collaboration between P&G's technology and Cargill's bioindustrial expertise has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions for years to come (Source: p. e), making it an attractive solution for both consumers and business leaders alike.

Paragraph 4: Continuous Learning and Improvement
At P&G, we recognize that sustainable product design is an ongoing process requiring continuous learning and improvement. Our commitment to human rights, gender equality, and nature-powered innovation are all integral parts of our broader mission to create a better world through our business operations (Source: p. f). By remaining responsive to stakeholder feedback and collaborating with partners like Cargill, we strive to push the boundaries of what is possible in sustainable product design.

Paragraph 5: Sustainability Reporting and Metrics
As part of our commitment to transparency, P&G reports on key sustainability metrics related to our products and operations (Source: p. g). These metrics include greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, waste reduction, and human rights performance, among others (Source: p. h). By sharing this information publicly, we aim to hold ourselves accountable to our stakeholders and demonstrate the progress we are making towards a more sustainable future.
