  P&G, a leading consumer goods company, demonstrates its commitment to sustainability through various initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The company's European plants donated thousands of protective masks, sanitizer, and hygiene products to health authorities and community organizations. In addition, P&G Turkey launched programs to support small businesses and families affected by the crisis.

In terms of environmental sustainability, P&G sets ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Furthermore, P&G supports renewable thermal collaboratives and reports according to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Transparency is a key aspect of P&G's sustainability efforts. The company shares more information than ever before about its product ingredients through initiatives such as SmartLabel. In 2019, P&G was recognized as a Safer Choice Partner of the Year for its transparency commitment.

P&G's reporting standards are rigorous and transparent, with external quality assurance by Lloyd's Register. The company is dedicated to creating access and opportunities for everyone, which includes innovative product design that caters to diverse communities.
