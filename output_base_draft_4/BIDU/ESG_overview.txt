  Baidu, the leading Chinese multinational technology company, is committed to promoting sustainable practices and upholding social responsibilities through various initiatives. The company provides extensive employee training programs with over 30,000 participants annually, boasting a high satisfaction rate of 92%. These self-developed courses cover topics on cutting-edge technologies, product methodologies, and industry trends to enhance professional capabilities and facilitate communication among employees (Document 1).

In terms of social commitments, Baidu empowers underrepresented groups by providing equal access to information and digital services, ensuring data equality for all. The company respects the rights to freedom of opinion and expression while adhering to national laws and regulations (Document 2). To enhance employee awareness of environmental protection, Baidu launched the "520, Low Carbon Action" campaign, calling on employees to reduce waste and adopt eco-friendly practices. The company also optimizes product design and services to ensure equal opportunities for disadvantaged groups to enjoy digital dividends (Document 3).

Baidu's ESG reporting adheres to international frameworks such as the International Labor Organization, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Document 4). The company has established a sophisticated customer service system through its Baidu Service Experience Development Center to provide excellent services for users (Document 5). Baidu's advertising policies prohibit promoting alcohol consumption or any related content, ensuring user safety and privacy (Document 6).

Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific information regarding the company's targets and achievements towards becoming carbon neutral or net-zero by a certain year. Additionally, there is no mention of reporting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), or IFRS in the provided documents.
