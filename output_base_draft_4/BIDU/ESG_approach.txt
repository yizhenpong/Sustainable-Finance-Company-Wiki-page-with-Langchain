  Title: Baidu's Approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) with a Focus on Alcohol Advertisement Restrictions

Baidu, a leading Chinese technology company, has been making significant strides in various fields, including culture preservation, personal information protection, and technological innovation. This section focuses on Baidu's ESG approach, particularly its efforts in alcohol advertisement restrictions.

In the cultural realm, Baidu launched the Baidu Digital Museum Project ten years ago, which has since grown to include thousands of digital collections from over 596 museums worldwide [1][2]. The project also features easy access to these collections and professional knowledge, making it possible for users to "visit museums across the country" digitally [1]. In addition, Baidu donated protective clothing, sets of technological facilities, and antigen reagents to support the fight against COVID-19 in Beijing [3].

Regarding personal information protection, Baidu has been recognized as a pioneer in this area. The company was awarded the title "Pioneering Practice Case in the Personal Information Protection Compliance Audit" from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) and the Institute of Internal Auditors in 2022 [3][4]. Baidu's proactivity and effectiveness in personal information protection risk audits have become an industry benchmark.

To ensure ESG compliance, Baidu adheres to various security standards, including those related to alcohol advertisement restrictions. For instance, the company follows the National Information Security Standardization Technical Committee (TC260) and the China Communications Standards Association (CCSA) guidelines on privacy policies for internet platforms, products, and services [5][6]. Moreover, Baidu conducts regular security audits to maintain system reliability and effectiveness [7].

In terms of social responsibility, Baidu has taken steps to improve accessibility for hearing-impaired users. The company developed an AI sign language platform all-in-one device, which is scalable and user-friendly [8]. Furthermore, Baidu's autonomous-driving architecture platform, Apollo Galaxy, has been used to develop redundant systems that ensure safety and reliability when components or systems fail [9].

Baidu also contributes to society by enhancing corporate governance, building trust, nurturing talent, improving services, and promoting green ideas [10]. The company's technology improves the efficiency of urban governance by addressing issues such as high energy consumption, carbon emissions, and traffic congestion [11][12]. For instance, Baidu developed a security risk detection and verification service platform for the industrial internet, which is a key project of the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2021-2025 [13].

In conclusion, Baidu's ESG approach encompasses various initiatives to ensure compliance with standards, protect personal information, improve accessibility, and promote social responsibility. Its efforts in areas such as alcohol advertisement restrictions demonstrate its commitment to responsible business practices and contribute to a more sustainable future.
