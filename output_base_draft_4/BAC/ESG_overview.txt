Header: ESG_overview 
  Bank of America (BofA) is committed to assisting its clients in managing climate-related risks and opportunities and aligning its strategy to reach net zero emissions before 2050. The bank reports its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using various reporting frameworks, including the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

In its 2022 TCFD report, BofA reported a combined absolute emissions number for 2019, which included thermal coal and midstream and downstream oil and gas production. However, in this year's reporting, the bank started reporting thermal coal production separately from midstream/downstream oil and gas production. The improvements to data and the application of appropriate IPCC factors for coal combustion better reflect the emissions specific to thermal coal extraction clients. BofA's net zero strategy aligns with the NZBA scenario selection criteria and is designed to achieve a 1.5Â°C pathway by 2050, as outlined in the IEA NZE2050 scenario. The bank's board regularly discusses climate-related topics through various channels and has specific responsibility for overseeing the company's environmental and social sustainability activities and practices.

BofA also discloses its net scope 1 and market-based scope 2 emissions, which totaled 1,750,939 metric tons CO2e in 2021, with a reduction of 100% compared to the base year. The bank undergoes third-party verification and assurance of its data, which can be viewed on its website. BofA's commitment to climate risk management and net zero strategy is an essential part of its transition to a sustainable future.
