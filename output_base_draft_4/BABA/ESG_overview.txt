  Alibaba Group, a leading technology company based in China, is committed to sustainable business practices and social responsibility. The company's ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives encompass various areas, including employee philanthropy, door-to-door delivery services, and compliance training.

Alibaba's employees are actively involved in philanthropic activities through the Alibaba Charity platform. In 2023, over 1,600 employees, external stakeholders, and professional judges selected socially influential and technologically innovative projects for funding. Furthermore, Alibaba recognizes that employee participation in philanthropy contributes to the overall development of the company as an ESG leader.

In terms of sustainability, Alibaba's doorstep delivery services through Cainiao offer convenience to consumers, with over 74% coverage as of March 31, 2023 (excluding rural areas and universities). The company also has a self-operated high-quality delivery team, Cainiao Direct Delivery, that provides doorstep delivery services for Tmall Supermarket in over 300 cities across China.

Regarding environmental sustainability, Alibaba recognizes the importance of managing climate risks and opportunities. In FY2023, the company conducted a comprehensive climate change risk and opportunity assessment to identify potential risks and opportunities related to transition and physical impacts. The findings were analyzed by risk management and business teams to assess impacts and develop strategies for risk mitigation and adaptation.

Alibaba's reporting standards include adherence to various frameworks such as IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board), SDG (Sustainable Development Goals), and CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project). The company's commitment to sustainability is further evidenced by its registration in Alibaba's procurement platform, where it specifies sustainable requirements for suppliers.

Additionally, Alibaba emphasizes fair competition through employee compliance training, with regular sessions covering over 910,000 person-times in FY2023 and mandatory compliance and risk awareness exams for all employees. The company also encourages open communication channels for feedback from both managers and employees to guide long-term work and direction.
