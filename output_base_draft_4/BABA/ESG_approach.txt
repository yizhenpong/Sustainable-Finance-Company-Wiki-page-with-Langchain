  Title: Doorstep Delivery Services' ESG Approach: Carbon Neutrality, Sustainable Campuses, and Data Security

Doorstep delivery services company XYZ is committed to sustainable finance and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. The company's efforts towards sustainability begin with its own operations and workspaces, creating a green, healthy, safe, and vibrant work environment for employees while promoting low-carbon practices [1].

XYZ has implemented systematic principles of sustainable campus construction. During the early stages of constructing campuses, eco-friendly and sustainable designs are adopted, along with low-carbon construction and renovations [1]. Moreover, during regular operations, the company continually explores digital intelligence to save energy and boost efficiency, effectively promoting energy transformation and resource recycling. XYZ also engages employees and suppliers in low-carbon practices to minimize the environmental footprint throughout its value chain [1].

XYZ's sustainable practices extend beyond its campuses. The company has developed simple packaging solutions tailored to specific industries and increased the use of original boxes during shipment, reducing unnecessary packaging and waste [2]. Additionally, reusable delivery bins are used in both warehouses and transport, making the supply chain more efficient and eco-friendly [2].

XYZ's approach to sustainability includes promoting carbon neutrality and conserving and restoring nature. The company has made significant strides in reducing carbon emissions throughout its operations (Scope 1 and 2), achieving a reduction of 21,409.4 MtCO2e [1]. Moreover, the value chain (Scope 3) saw an emission reduction of 8,067.9 MtCO2e [1].

Data security is another important aspect of XYZ's ESG strategy. The company has implemented data desensitization as a foundation and uses trusted computing environments from hardware to software to protect customer data from tampering [3]. Additionally, XYZ participates in international organizations' initiatives to discuss the promotion of Scope 3+ emission reduction standards worldwide [4].

XYZ is also committed to social responsibility. The company works with various stakeholders, including industry groups and standardization bodies, to develop and adhere to group standards for emission reduction [5][6]. Furthermore, during the pandemic, XYZ's Aoxiang platform collaborated with merchants on timeliness services to inform consumers of potential delivery delays and reduced return rates, ensuring logistics resilience under challenging conditions [7].

In summary, Doorstep delivery services company XYZ's ESG approach focuses on carbon neutrality, sustainable campuses, and data security. Through its various initiatives, the company has made significant strides in reducing its carbon footprint, implementing eco-friendly practices, and protecting customer data while ensuring logistics resilience.

 Sub header: GHG inventory (Scopes 1-3) 
  Alibaba Group, the multinational conglomerate based in China, has taken a leading role in sustainable finance and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) evaluation, particularly in the area of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory management. The company's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint is evident through its adherence to international reporting standards and collaboration with renowned academic institutions.

Alibaba applies the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, which is a widely accepted framework for companies to quantify their entire carbon emissions footprint (Scopes 1-3). Scope 1 refers to direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the company; Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from purchased energy; and Scope 3 accounts for all other indirect emissions, including those resulting from the supply chain.

In line with this standard, Alibaba follows the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, ensuring transparency and accuracy in its GHG reporting (Appendix 4). The company also complies with other applicable laws, regulations, and related standards.

The significance of GHG inventory management is underscored in Alibaba's Climate-related Risks and Opportunities Assessment Report (Appendix 5), which identifies ten material climate risks and opportunities. These include potential regulatory changes, technological advancements, and impacts on supply chain relationships, among others.

Alibaba has been actively addressing climate risks through various initiatives. For instance, the company's "Daily Positive Energy" program focuses on energy conservation and carbon reduction. According to a Ten-year Evaluation Report released by the China Philanthropy Research Institute of Beijing Normal University (http:/ /www.bnu1.org/show_2798.html), this program has significantly reduced Alibaba's energy consumption and carbon emissions since its inception (5).

Moreover, Alibaba places a strong emphasis on environmental strategy and governance. The company has established a Governance working group responsible for assessing and governing key fields related to science and technology ethics. By making use of systems and tools to engage science and technology ethics governance in daily scientific research activities, Alibaba ensures that its innovations align with ethical principles while minimizing GHG emissions (6).

Although this text primarily focuses on the environmental aspect of ESG evaluation, it's important to note that social and governance factors also play essential roles in Alibaba's sustainable finance efforts. For a more comprehensive understanding of the company's approach to these areas, please refer to other sections of the Wikipedia page.

  Alibaba Group, the multinational technology conglomerate, is committed to promoting sustainable finance and social responsibility through various initiatives, including competition compliance training. This section focuses on Alibaba's efforts in enhancing accessibility for people with disabilities and maintaining fair competition.

Firstly, Alibaba is dedicated to making digital technology accessible to all, including individuals with visual impairments (Tan, 2023, p. 130). The company's apps, Taobao and Tmall, utilize optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert text into speech, enabling visually impaired users to shop conveniently (p. 130). In FY2023 alone, more than 320,000 visually impaired individuals benefited from voice-overs and screen-reading guides to order food or shop on various apps (p. 130). Moreover, Alibaba Health released a medicine box supporting Braille-Chinese conversion, providing safe and convenient medication usage for the visually impaired community (p. 130).

Additionally, Alibaba is enhancing accessibility in travel through the "Wheelchair Navigation" mode on Amap (Tan, 2023, p. 130-131). This feature automatically navigates around potential obstacles, improving access for wheelchair users (p. 131). Furthermore, Alibaba is also committed to involving more autistic youths in social activities, creating a pathway to self-reliance (p. 131).

To maintain fair competition, Alibaba conducts competition compliance risk monitoring in essential areas such as contracts, platform rules, data disclosure, resource allocation, and product designs (Tan, 2023, p. 131). Employees are regulated through related manuals and an anti-unfair competition reporting email is available: competition-compliance@alibaba-inc.com (p. 131). Alibaba prioritizes a favorable market environment for fair competition, with different businesses implementing regulations like the Taobao Regulations on Competition Behavior Management (p. 131).

Lastly, Alibaba is exploring innovative solutions to promote agricultural products and rural revitalization, contributing to sales exceeding RMB130 billion in FY2023 for previously impoverished counties (Tan, 2023, p. 4.3 billion) (p. 131). Alibaba continues to incubate agricultural product brands and promote these Chinese products and experiences globally (p. 131). In FY2023, sales of goods for rural residents exceeded RMB130 billion on their platforms, while total sales for national key counties reached RMB4.3 billion (p. 131).
